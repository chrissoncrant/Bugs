# Bugs

This is a simple practice site to help me get used to how to github. Decided that a fun topic would be a simple list of some of my favorite bugs.

## About Me

Starting out on the exciting journey of learning to code. I am excited where this will take me and all that I will encounter along the way, good and bad.

## Special Thanks

Thanks to the Thinkful prep course for the Engineering Immersion program which helped guide me through the steps of getting started here!
